## Installation

1. Download the files (you can clone on github)
2. in terminal, run "npm i" to install modules required.


## Usage

1. Open the folder in terminal.
2. Run "node index.js"
3. Answer the questions as they come up.  You can choose which sections you'd like to add to the README, and the program will ask the relevant questions.
4. The generator will create a folder in "output", named with your project title.  The README will be written into there.  
5. There will also be a JSON file containing the data.  That can be ignored, it's for future plans of being able to edit the README after its been generated.
